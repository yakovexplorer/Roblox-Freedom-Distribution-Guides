## How to find the patch?

## Background

I found a version of Studio from late 2021 ([v493.1.15175](https://archive.org/details/roblox-version-1fca050e38094184)) with a patch applied in x86 such that no login screen would be required. There was a change from `jnz` to `jz` at file address `0x002B951C`. This patch was location near a unique string reference to `"Studio.App.AutoSaveDialog.OpenRobloxFile"`. The specific fix that Reggie applied, however, can't be reproduced in my target versions of v348 and v463. However, a very similar one has been confirmed to work in v463.

## Discovery

When you launch v463 Studio without command-line arguments, you are presented with a login screen.

You may be tempted to try bypassing this through several methods:

1. **Ctrl + O:** a similar message shows up: `"You must log in to open files."`

2. **Dragging to Topbar:** in 2021, the login screen could be bypassed by dragging the desired file from File Explorer to the top of the Studio window. This option does not work in current-day (late 2025) versions of Studio.

3. **Ctrl + N:** Rōblox has this action accounted for. An error string `"You must log in to create new files."` shows up. Let's investigate this option further with x64dbg.

In the `RobloxStudioBeta.exe` v463 executable, there are no results for the string `"You must log in to create new files."`

However, you will find that string in the Rōblox Client Tracker data at [`./QtResources/Translation/StudioStringsUntranslated.csv`](https://github.com/MaximumADHD/Roblox-Client-Tracker/blob/f867742be117235b24b2be7500eada1d20ba42f3/QtResources/Translation/StudioStringsUntranslated.csv#L789). The translation-agnostic key is **`"Studio.App.MainWindow.LogInToCreateNewFiles"`**. The CSV data was compressed as a Qt resource. The Client Tracker used the [qtextract](https://github.com/axstin/qtextract.git) tool to extract the CSV data.

I search for string references in user modules in `RobloxStudioBeta.exe` v463 executable (using x64dbg) for `"Studio.App.MainWindow.LogInToCreateNewFiles"`. One result shows up at address `000000014026CD15`.

I add a breakpoint right there at `000000014026CD15`. I make sure that Studio is at the starting login screen and hit Ctrl + N again. The breakpoint is hit.

I step over the execution trace and notice that the message box shows up during a call to `robloxstudiobeta.140266D90`. This call is the first instruction after the breakpoint to use opcode `E8` and is located at `000000014026CD59`: some 12 instructions after the breakpoint.

The routine we're calling begins at `0000000140266D90` and ends at `0000000140266FA1`. Judging by the `mov al, 0x1` near the end, we can infer that it returns a boolean.

To reach the branch where `1` is returned, we need to ensure that `al` is also `1` when the EIP is at `0000000140266EDB`. This is evident by how the statement I notated as `{A1}` can jump directly to `{A2}`. We know that this is the only way to reach this branch because:

1. An unconditional `jmp` instruction is placed in the statement prior to `{B2}`.
2. The statement prior to `{A2}` is a `ret` instruction, effectively serving as a jump.

Owing to the `jmp` statement per (1), we know that `al` comes from some other place, that being before `{B1}`, which is a jump for an unrelated condition. The `al` originates from the result of a function call at `{C}`.

To determine the exact address of this call, we need to add another breakpoint. We do the same test as before to get this breakpoint captured. Once hit, _step into_ that function. In v463, that destination function begins at `00000001405F2100`.

We apply the following patch to ensure that the function always returns a truish vaue.
