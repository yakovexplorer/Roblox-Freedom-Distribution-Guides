# How I patched DataModelPatch for 2021E (v463)

I took the Rōblox client binary from [here](https://setup.rbxcdn.com/version-5a54208fe8e24e87-RobloxApp.zip).

I then did took the patches from [this guide](../Worships2021EGuide/README.md) and made a few more which weren't relevant to `DataModelPatch`.

Dum Rōblox decided that they won't load `./Content/models/DataModelPatch/DataModelPatch.rbxm` if it's been modified. Not to worry; I patched the signing requirement out.

Refer to [`DataModelPatchPatch.1337`](./DataModelPatchPatch.1337). Import it into **x32**dbg or something!

With those patches, I took out the SIGN chunk at the end -- and everything loaded fine. It took me 2 or 3 days to do.

No Python was needed. Just many tries, traces, and branch-changes in x32dbg.

And I'm not done yet...

## DataModelPatch Bytecode Analysis

This is a super rough draft. Things do not make full sense now and _will_ be refined as we develop further.

### Preparation

1. Download [`DataModelPatch.rbxm`](DataModelPatch.rbxm). For Rōblox v463, `DataModelPatch.rbxm` can be pulled from:

```sh
curl -L "https://assetdelivery.roblox.com/v1/asset/?id=5345954812&version=897"
```

2. Decompress the `lz4` chunks. I'd save them to a new file. The following Python code snippet requires a module Rōblox Freedom Distribution to be imported:

```py
from assets.serialisers import rbxl as parser
read_file_name = "./DataModelPatch.rbxm"
write_file_name = "./DataModelPatchDecompressed.rbxm"

read_data = open(read_file_name, 'rb').read()
write_data = parser.parse(read_data, methods={})
open(write_file_name, 'wb').write(write_data)
```

### Basic Metadata Collection (Script Names)

Open the newly decompressed file in a hex-editing tool. Write down the address of the byte highlighted below. The `0x01` right after `Name` corresponds to the `String` [property type](https://github.com/RobloxAPI/spec/blob/master/formats/rbxl.md#value-types). So we want to collect the byte right after this metadatum.

![alt text](image.png)

In this case, we're using `0x00094888` as the base address. The reason that these bytes follow as `0A 00 00 00` is because the `Connection` string afterwards is ten characters long.

And then:

```py
b = 0x00094888

b0 = b
head = b''
names = []
while True:
  head = write_data[b0:b0+4]
  if head == b'PROP':
   break
  l = int.from_bytes(head, 'little')
  e1 = b0 + 4
  e2 = b0 + 4 + l
  val = write_data[e1:e2]
  names.append((e1, e2, val))
  b0 += l + 4
```

That's just to get the names, which will be saved in the `names` list.

Now to get the values of the "Source" property.

### Bytecode Collection

Repeat for "Source". The 0x1D is _supposed_ to refer to the value type for [bytecode](https://github.com/strawbberrys/0x1D/tree/master/bytecode-poc).

![alt text](image-1.png)

```py
b = 0x000B5407

b0 = b
head = b''
sources = []
while True:
  head = write_data[b0:b0+4]
  if head == b'PROP':
   break
  l = int.from_bytes(head, 'little')
  e1 = b0 + 4
  e2 = b0 + 4 + l
  val = write_data[e1:e2]
  sources.append((e1, e2, val))
  b0 += l + 4
```

The bytecode dumps are saved in a list named `sources`.

### [`DataModelPatchBytecodes.zip`](DataModelPatchBytecodes.zip)

In the previous two sections, we collected `names` and `sources`. Time to save them to a file.

```py
for n,s in zip(names, sources):
 fn=(
  rb'%08x-%s'
  %(s[0], n[2].split(b'/')[-1])
 ).decode('utf-8')
 with open(fn, 'wb') as f:
  f.write(d[s[0]:s[1]])
```

In a script named `NotifyReady.lua` (there are like three copies in DataModelPatch),

There is content:

```lua
return {}
```

Bytecode:

```
A0 7B E7 85 B1 CC 49 58 12 C5 C2 01 FE 33 84 A1 82 78 34 44 27 5D D9 E8 CB 04 DE 8C 6E A4 DE 30 90 48 C7 D5 AE EC 69 78 5A 90 0E 1C D7 B6 E4 02 92 D8 70
```

In the CoreScripts, `CompleteRequest.lua` has the exact same content as `PurchaseCompleteRecieved.lua` and `RequestPremiumPurchase.lua` and `StartHidingPrompt.lua`.

Bytecode is:

```

```

```lua
local makeActionCreator = require(script.Parent.makeActionCreator)

return makeActionCreator(script.Name)
```

Let's compare `ProductInfoReceived.lua`:

```lua
local makeActionCreator = require(script.Parent.makeActionCreator)

return makeActionCreator(script.Name, "productInfo")
```

```
4E D9 17 D6 7C 2E F9 8B 4C 67 B2 D2 28 CA 3C D7 AC 88 AC 68 74 3E 48 52 F4 AD 19 94 A5 C9 08 FF 70 45 11 B4 F0 5D 54 59 66 28 BD 4E 8B 7E 7C 46 DE BA 53 DA A2 90 97 C2 0A 7D AA 05 28 F9 A5 D2 FA 60 F9 0E B3 64 07 C8 72 B6 83 7B B6 DB 61 C0 5D 8C F1 18 AC A8 FF 64 77 4A 07 67 1B E9 4B 92 83 93 40 4C 34 7C 00 29 8C 86 75 41 6C 57 8A 3E 12 9E 5D BB D1 6A 86 6E 45 BE 2F 8C 80 74 36 D2 FE FE 03 52 1A 3A E7 7E E4 88 C6 C8 12 4A 9C 09 2A 9F 65 DC 89 FE DC AC 6E 18 B9 7D 70 01 F0 41
```

With `PremiumInfoRecieved.lua`:

```lua
local makeActionCreator = require(script.Parent.makeActionCreator)

return makeActionCreator(script.Name, "premiumInfo")
```

```
0D BE 18 97 BF 91 FE 4A 8F 80 8D 13 6B 65 2B 96 EF EF 23 28 B0 51 4F 57 37 39 0D B2 D0 E9 F4 5B 19 DE 32 E2 65 3B 2B F8 17 9F 36 23 6C F9 76 35 78 EB 39 44 91 1F 54 E4 A8 4E E8 3E 34 DF 2F F7 24 66 B7 15 45 8F 19 25 AD 5A F9 51 9D E9 5C 82 45 54 7D 6A 99 FA B1 07 21 30 FE 5F C4 34 8E 1D C2 B7 BB 0E 99 BA BD 49 56 55 EA 0F 8C 18 27 71 22 6C 2E 0A 3E 48 2A 29 48 51 82 D0 E9 29 56 BC 91 5B DC BD 53 82 F0 4E 1E 4C 80 E6 58 52 15 17 6F D6 33 76 C6 96 14 A0 A3 07 DA 79 FA 4B
```

I think that the code is encrypted.

If it wasn't, any strings would be plainly visible in the bytecode.
